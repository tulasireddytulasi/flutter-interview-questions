##### 3. Difference between encryption and hashing?

Encryption and hashing are two different cryptographic techniques used for different purposes:

Encryption:
- Encryption is a reversible process that converts plaintext data into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a key.
- The same key or a related key can be used to decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.
- Encryption is used to protect data during transmission or storage to ensure confidentiality.
- Common encryption algorithms include AES, DES, RSA, etc.

Hashing:
- Hashing is a one-way process that converts data of any length into a fixed-size digest or hash value.
- The process is irreversible; the original data cannot be recovered from the hash value.
- Hashing is primarily used for data integrity checks and secure password storage.
- Common hashing algorithms include MD5, SHA-256, SHA-3, etc.

Key Differences:
- Encryption is reversible, while hashing is a one-way process.
- Encryption requires a key, while hashing does not.
- Encryption protects data confidentiality, while hashing ensures data integrity.
- Encrypted data can be decrypted with the correct key, but hashed data cannot be reversed.
- Hashing is faster than encryption and is commonly used for password storage and file integrity checks.

In summary, encryption is used to protect data confidentiality during transmission or storage, while hashing is used to ensure data integrity and secure password storage.

##### 4. Explain about Common Encryption Algorithms like AES, DES, RSA, and MD5, SHA-256, SHA-3

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of common encryption algorithms used in security:

##### 1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
   - **Type:** Symmetric Key Algorithm
   - **Key Sizes:** 128, 192, or 256 bits
   - **Use Case:** Widely used for securing data in applications, networks, and hardware.
   - **Description:** AES is a highly secure and fast encryption algorithm, replacing the older DES algorithm. It is used for encrypting sensitive data in applications like wireless communication, VPNs, and disk encryption.

#####  2. **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
   - **Type:** Symmetric Key Algorithm
   - **Key Size:** 56 bits
   - **Use Case:** Historically used in securing sensitive information, but now considered insecure due to its short key length.
   - **Description:** DES was one of the earliest encryption standards but is now considered obsolete due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Triple DES (3DES) was introduced as an improvement by applying DES encryption three times with different keys.

##### 3. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**
   - **Type:** Asymmetric Key Algorithm
   - **Key Size:** 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits
   - **Use Case:** Commonly used for securing data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange.
   - **Description:** RSA is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm. It uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is commonly used in secure data transmission, SSL/TLS certificates, and digital signatures.

##### 4. **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**
   - **Type:** Cryptographic Hash Function
   - **Output Size:** 128-bit hash
   - **Use Case:** Previously used for integrity checks but now considered insecure.
   - **Description:** MD5 generates a fixed 128-bit hash value from input data. It was widely used for verifying data integrity, but due to vulnerabilities (like collision attacks), it is now considered insecure and deprecated in favor of more secure hash algorithms like SHA-256.

##### 5. **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**
   - **Type:** Cryptographic Hash Function
   - **Output Size:** 256-bit hash
   - **Use Case:** Data integrity verification, digital signatures, and blockchain technology.
   - **Description:** SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family and is widely used for generating a fixed 256-bit hash from input data. It is more secure than MD5 and is used in digital certificates, cryptographic protocols like SSL/TLS, and in blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin).

##### 6. **SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)**
   - **Type:** Cryptographic Hash Function
   - **Output Size:** Variable (224, 256, 384, or 512-bit hashes)
   - **Use Case:** Data integrity verification, cryptography, and digital signatures.
   - **Description:** SHA-3 is the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, designed as a backup for SHA-2. It provides a different cryptographic construction (using the Keccak algorithm) and is resistant to the same vulnerabilities that affect previous hash functions.

##### Summary:
- **AES** and **DES** are symmetric key algorithms used for encrypting data.
- **RSA** is an asymmetric algorithm used for secure data transmission and key exchange.
- **MD5**, **SHA-256**, and **SHA-3** are hash functions used for verifying data integrity, with SHA-256 and SHA-3 being more secure than MD5.

##### 6. What is the purpose of using HTTPS instead of HTTP?

HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for secure communication over the internet. It is used to ensure that data is transmitted securely and privately between a web server and a client (e.g., a browser). Here are the key reasons why HTTPS is preferred over HTTP:  

1. **Data Confidentiality:** HTTPS encrypts all data sent between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
2. **Data Integrity:** HTTPS ensures that the data received by the client is identical to the data sent by the server, preventing tampering.
3. **Authentication:** HTTPS provides server authentication, ensuring that the user is connected to the correct and legitimate server.
4. **Encryption:** HTTPS uses encryption algorithms to secure the data transmitted between the client and server.
5. **Privacy:** HTTPS provides privacy by encrypting all data transmitted between the client and server.

In summary, HTTPS is preferred over HTTP because it provides secure and private communication between the client and server.
