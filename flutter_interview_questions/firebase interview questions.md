     - **Facebook Sign-In:** OAuth-based authentication via Facebook.
     - **Twitter Sign-In:** OAuth-based authentication via Twitter.
     - **Anonymous Authentication:** Temporary user credentials.

6. **How do you handle user sign-in, sign-out, and registration using Firebase Authentication?**
   - **Answer:** Use `firebase_auth` methods:
     - **Sign-in:** `await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);`
     - **Registration:** `await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);`
     - **Sign-out:** `await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();`
     Handle errors and user states accordingly in your UI.

### Firestore

7. **How do you read and write data to Firestore in a Flutter app?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `cloud_firestore` package. To write data:
     ```dart
     FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).set({
       'name': 'John Doe',
       'age': 30,
     });
     ```
     To read data:
     ```dart
     DocumentSnapshot snapshot = await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).get();
     Map<String, dynamic> data = snapshot.data()!;
     ```

8. **What are the differences between Cloud Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database?**
   - **Answer:** Cloud Firestore offers richer querying capabilities, hierarchical data structure, and offline support. Firebase Realtime Database is a simpler, flat JSON structure with real-time synchronization. Firestore provides more advanced querying, better scalability, and more complex data structures.

9. **How do you set up Firestore security rules?**
   - **Answer:** Configure Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console under the "Rules" tab. You can write rules to control read and write access based on user authentication status and document fields. For example:
     ```plaintext
     service cloud.firestore {
       match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /users/{userId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

10. **How do you structure data in Firestore for a scalable Flutter app?**
    - **Answer:** Structure data with a focus on how it will be queried. Use subcollections to manage related data, and denormalize data to reduce the need for complex joins. Avoid deeply nested documents to ensure efficient queries.

### Firebase Storage

11. **How do you upload and download files to Firebase Storage in a Flutter app?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `firebase_storage` package:
      - **Upload:** 
        ```dart
        final ref = FirebaseStorage.instance.ref().child('uploads/$fileName');
        await ref.putFile(file);
        ```
      - **Download:**
        ```dart
        final ref = FirebaseStorage.instance.ref().child('uploads/$fileName');
        String url = await ref.getDownloadURL();
        ```

12. **What are some best practices for handling large files or media uploads?**
    - **Answer:** Use Firebase Storage’s resumable uploads to handle large files, and consider using Firebase Cloud Functions to process or compress files server-side. Implement error handling and progress monitoring to provide a smooth user experience.

### Cloud Functions

13. **What are Firebase Cloud Functions, and how do you use them with Flutter?**
    - **Answer:** Firebase Cloud Functions are server-side functions that run in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. In Flutter, you call these functions via HTTP requests using packages like `http` or `dio`. For example:
      ```dart
      final response = await http.post('https://your-region-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/yourFunction', body: {'key': 'value'});
      ```

14. **Can you give an example of a use case for Firebase Cloud Functions in a Flutter application?**
    - **Answer:** A common use case is sending a welcome email to users upon registration. You can trigger a Cloud Function on user creation and use an email-sending service to send the email.

### Performance and Analytics

15. **How do you integrate Firebase Analytics into a Flutter app?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `firebase_analytics` package. Initialize Firebase Analytics and log events:
      ```dart
      FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics();
      analytics.logEvent(name: 'event_name', parameters: {'param1': 'value1'});
      ```

16. **What types of metrics can you track using Firebase Analytics?**
    - **Answer:** Metrics include user engagement, retention, user demographics, in-app purchases, screen views, and custom events. Firebase Analytics provides insights into user behavior and app performance.

17. **How do you use Firebase Performance Monitoring in Flutter?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `firebase_performance` package to monitor performance. You can track network request timings, custom traces, and app startup times:
      ```dart
      FirebasePerformance performance = FirebasePerformance.instance;
      Trace trace = performance.newTrace('trace_name');
      trace.start();
      // Code to measure
      trace.stop();
      ```

### Push Notifications

18. **How do you set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications in Flutter?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `firebase_messaging` package. Configure FCM in the Firebase Console and add required permissions in Android and iOS configurations. Initialize the package and set up background and foreground message handlers:
      ```dart
      FirebaseMessaging messaging = FirebaseMessaging.instance;
      messaging.getToken().then((token) {
        print("FCM Token: $token");
      });
      FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen((RemoteMessage message) {
        // Handle foreground messages
      });
      ```

19. **What are the different types of notifications supported by FCM?**
    - **Answer:** FCM supports notifications such as foreground notifications (when the app is in use), background notifications (when the app is in the background), and data-only messages that are processed by the app.

20. **How do you handle background and foreground notifications in Flutter?**
    - **Answer:** For foreground notifications, use `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen` to handle the messages. For background notifications, handle them in the `onBackgroundMessage` callback. Configure both in your app’s initialization code.

### Testing

21. **How do you test Firebase integration in a Flutter app?**
    - **Answer:** Test Firebase integration using unit tests and integration tests. Mock Firebase services using packages like `mockito` or `firebase_mocks`. Verify that Firebase services are called correctly and handle responses properly.
